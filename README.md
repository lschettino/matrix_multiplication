# optimized algorithm for matrix_multiplication

Programming assignment for algorithm's class to implement a variant of Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication. 

Due to the recursive nature of Strassen's algorithm, for small enough matrices
it is actually faster to multiply matrices conventionally. 

The goal of this project was to experimentally determine the cross-over point (n0) 
such that conventional multiplication is faster and implement both the 
conventional multiplication and Strassen's algorithm and combine 
both methods to achieve optimized matrix multiplication.
